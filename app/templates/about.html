			<h1>About SocDoc</h1>
			
			<p>
				Welcome to SocDoc, your number one source for all things sock-related. We're dedicated to giving you the very best socks, with a focus on quality products, low prices, and customer satisfaction.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Founded in 2018 by Paul Bundac, KerryAnn DeMeester, and Megan Rapach, SocDoc has come a long way from its beginnings as a Monmouth University grad-level web security class project. When SocDoc first started out, our passion for personalized socks drove us to expand our store so that SocDoc can offer you the coolest socks at the lowest prices. We now serve customers all over the United States, and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own web store.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Sincerely,<br>
				Paul, KerryAnn, and Megan
